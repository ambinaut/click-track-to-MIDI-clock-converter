# click-track-to-MIDI-clock-converter

The click track to MIDI clock is a converter that listens to incoming click track and creates a MIDI clock signal. 

Pulse to MIDI - A.Comp (Up_01).cpp is the main file.
The files my_defines.h and my_macros.h need to be in the directory as Pulse to MIDI - A.Comp (Up_01).cpp.
